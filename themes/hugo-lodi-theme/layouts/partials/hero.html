            <p>I'm a software engineer with over 14 years of successes and bugs. Over the years I've compiled my own
                Gentoo distro, fixed Linux drivers to compile in my own machine (Ubuntu and user-friendly distros didn't
                exist at that time -- <i>long live Slackware</i>), translated games to pt-BR, created petty
                projects with C and OpenGL, and some game levels in Quake Action and Counter-Strike. Adopted C libraries
                to integrate with Java Native Interface and to make it work on pin pads and fiscal printers. Made some
                fun stuff with XSS and SQL Injection -- <i>interesting how systems can be fragile to attacks</i>, and I
                believe
                SQL should be more used. On the Web world, I've worked with HTML, CSS, PHP, Java, JavaScript, Emberjs,
                and
                Angularjs in the past, and some other obscure techs like Oracle Forms and Oracle Reports.</p>

            <p>I've worked on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Engineering_Process_Group">Software
                    Engineering Process Group</a> for a company with over 50 developers and nearly 100 projects, where
                I learned soft skills to deal with people with different skill sets and mindsets, which
                was a foundation to help me define and guide a 100% remote team on my current company, where we work
                based on async communication, virtual Kanban board, and CI/CD techniques.</p>

            <p>I believe community is an important part of our field, so I used to coordinate, along with some friends,
                a local meetup called <a href="https://www.meetup.com/hack-river/">hack.river</a> from 2016 to 2018 with
                more than 300 members, where I gave a talk presenting Elixir in 2016 and since then I have been
                contributing to
                the Elixir community. Currently, I'm co-coordinator of <a
                    href="https://www.meetup.com/Elixir-User-Group-RP/">Elixir User Group RP</a>.</p>

            <p>Nowadays I'm more into Ruby, Rails, Elixir, and Phoenix, having contributed to Elixir, Ecto, Ecto
                SQL, Plug, GenStage, and some other projects -- <i>please check out <a
                        href="https://github.com/leandrocp">my GitHub profile</a></i>. And <a
                    href="https://hub.docker.com/u/leandrocp/">create some stuff with Docker</a>,
                which is a lifesaver to boot up local servers for development. I also like
                to write about
                software development on <a href="https://medium.com/@leandrocesquini">my blog on Medium</a>, having
                been
                featured in popular media like Plataformatec
                newsletter, ElixirWeekly, and freeCodeCamp publication. <a
                    href="https://github.com/lnasystems/fullstack-learning-path">Mentoring new developers</a> is an
                activity that has a lot of responsibility, but it's something that I like to do. On the last couple of
                years, I'm also performing a management role leading a remote team.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I like to build things and experiment with new ideas. üòÅ</p>

            <p>Currently working at <a href="https://lnasystems.com.br">LNA Systems</a> performing technical and
                management roles. Check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leandrocesquini/">professional
